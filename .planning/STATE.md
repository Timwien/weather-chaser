# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-26)

**Core value:** Show travelers where the best weather is — and for campervan trips, the optimal multi-day route to chase it — through real towns, not dots on a grid
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Core Algorithm + Route Planner Web

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: Full rebuild — not incremental patching. Static HTML/JS MVP is proof-of-concept only.
- [Init]: Turborepo monorepo with packages/core (pure TS algorithm), apps/web, apps/mobile, apps/api
- [Init]: MapLibre GL JS on web, @rnmapbox/maps on native — two distinct map implementations, not shared
- [Init]: Route optimizer runs client-side (fast, deterministic, no server round-trip)
- [Init]: Supabase (Frankfurt region) for auth + Postgres + GDPR compliance

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1]: @rnmapbox/maps + current Expo SDK compatibility must be verified before committing to map stack (research flag from SUMMARY.md)
- [Phase 1]: Open-Meteo free tier commercial use policy must be verified — may require commercial plan from launch
- [Phase 1]: Nominatim/OSRM demo server production policies must be confirmed; self-hosting/proxying is the answer regardless
- [Phase 3]: OSRM self-hosting requirements (memory, disk, EU OSM extract update cadence) need verification
